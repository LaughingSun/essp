# essp
ECMAScript Server Pages

"essp" is a module for parsing and rendering server side javascript pages.  This core module is somewhat abstract to enable it to be implemented on many different platforms.  A number of wrapper modules are included to enable easy out-of-the-virtual-box use.

Wrapper modules currently provided for Node and V8+http-server.  A few more are planned including one for common-nix rapsberry.
